# Chimera Linux Config

Having recently discovered and switching to [Chimera Linux](https://chimera-linux.org/) on my laptop, this repository contains
my configuration files for apk's world, dotfiles, etc.

> **Impressions**
> - `apk` being able to search for, and install, packages based on a `cmd:` or `so:` prefix is amazing.
> - The plug-and-play functionality on a musl-based distro is very welcome.
